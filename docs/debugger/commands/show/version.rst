Show remake version (show version)
----------------------------------

**show version**

Show the remake version.

The first number part of the version is the GNU Make base version.
After that comes a remake-specific value which indicates its release iteration.

Example:
--------

::
      show version
      version: 4.3+dbg-1.5

The above is based on GNU Make 4.3; remake's features are at level 1.5.
