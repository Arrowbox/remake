Breakpoints
===========

A *breakpoint* causes `remake` to stop when it reaches a Makefile target.

The debugger assigns a number to each breakpoint when you create it;
these numbers are successive integers starting with 1. In many of the
commands for controlling various features of breakpoints you use this
number.
