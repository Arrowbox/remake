Skip target (`skip`)
--------------------

**skip**

Skip executing the remaining commands of the target you are stopped
at. This may be useful if you have an action that "fixes" existing
code in a Makefile.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`next <next>` command. :ref:`step <step>`, :ref:`continue <continue>`, and :ref:`finish <finish>` provide other ways to progress execution.
