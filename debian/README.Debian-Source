 This source package does not include GNU Make documentation
 (which has a license that does not pass DFSG muster), and the build
 system has been adjusted accordingly. The sources of the binary make
 program are in the source package remake-dfsg. The full unredacted
 sources can be had from non-free in make-doc-non-dfsg.
