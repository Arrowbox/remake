remake (4.1+dbg1.1+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Dima Kogan ]
  * New upstream release (Closes: #804180, #806552)
  * Culled remake.texi and make.texi since they are not DFSG-compliant
  * Imported some patches from the 'make' Debian package:
    - We don't get as confused with timestamp-less .a files, which are now
      made by default on Debian (Debian bugs #798804, #798913)
    - We can handle excessively long commandlines (Debian bug #688601)
    - We handle NULL return from ttyname
  * New upstream supports Guile, so we use (and Depend on) it

  [ Yaroslav Halchenko ]
  * debian/control
    - Make Dima the Maintainer and downgrade myself into Uploaders
    - Boost up policy compliance to 3.9.8 (no changes)

remake (3.81+dbg0.2~dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release(s): resolved issue with deprecated emacs
    list syntax (Closes: #499956)
  * Using upstream checkout 43ea2cdf4a8cec7c1c1b9827046e71258b77008f
    instead of the latest release, since there were few fixes introduced
    since the release
  * Due to upstream switch to git, remake git repository now contains
    sources for vanilla make, remake, and Debian packaging.
  * Added VCS fields into the header.
  * Extended list of copyright holders due to added pieces.
  * Not using dpatch any longer.
  * Redoing DFSG compliance of a new remake:
    - documents with GFDL with cover pages (info/html) are removed
      and FDL license is no longer shipped
    - remake-specific info file is no longer present/shipped
    - vanilla make changelog is no longer shipped separate,
      please refer to /usr/share/doc/make/changelog.gz which contains
      entries for both make and remake
  * Updated compliance to policy 3.8.0
  * Using autotools at package build time, it required also custom clean
    up in clean rule of debian/rules
