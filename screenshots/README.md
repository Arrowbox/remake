The "cast" screenshots were made with asciienea, e.g. `asciinema reg remake-session1.cast`,
and then running through `asciicast2gif`.

You can edit the `.cast` files. The specific commands used after this were:

```console
$ asciicast2gif -w 60 -h 4 remake-session0.cast remake-session0.gif
$ asciicast2gif -w 57 -h 20 remake-session1.cast remake-session1.gif
$ asciicast2gif -w 57 -h 10 remake-session2.cast remake-session2.gif
```
